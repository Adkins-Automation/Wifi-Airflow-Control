# Wifi Airflow Control
WiFi-controlled air-duct damper that can be used to control the airflow and temperature in different rooms/areas of a home

This project aims to create a WiFi controlled air duct damper for use in residential and commercial HVAC systems. The device will allow users to remotely adjust the airflow in specific rooms or areas, helping to optimize temperature control and save energy.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have the following materials:

- ESP8266 or ESP32 microcontroller
- Motor driver board
- Servo motor
- Duct damper
- Power supply
- Jumper wires
- PCB board
- Housing material (such as 3D printed or laser-cut parts)
- Installation
- Clone the repository onto your local machine.
- Open the project files in your preferred code editor.
- Upload the code to your ESP8266 or ESP32 microcontroller.
- Connect the motor driver board, servo motor, and duct damper to the microcontroller.
- Connect the power supply to the motor driver board.
- Assemble the housing for the hardware.

## Usage
To use the WiFi controlled air duct damper, follow these steps:

1. Connect the device to your WiFi network.
2. Use a smartphone, tablet, or computer to access the device's web interface.
3. Adjust the damper to control the airflow in specific rooms or areas.

## Save energy and money
 According to [Direct Energy](https://www.directenergy.com/learning-center/what-uses-most-electricity-in-my-home)
 >As your main source of comfort from extreme outdoor temperatures, your HVAC system uses the most energy of any single appliance or system at 46 percent of the average U.S. home's energy consumption.

## Control from anywhere via mobile app or browser
